The codes were used in the analysis of Mycobiome and Microbiome data generated from EPICON project.

EPICON is a DOE funded project conceived of by Peggy G. Lemaux, Devin Coleman-Derr, Elizabeth Purdom, John Vogel, Jeffery A. Dahlberg and John W. Taylor, with Peggy G. Lemaux as director. EPICON aimed at understanding responses of sorghum to drought, from host gene expression to host-associated microbiome.

Briefly, we collected 1026 sample from three treatments, two sorghum culrivars, 17 time points and four compartments.

            Three treatments: control, pre-flowering drought and post-flowering drought
      
            Two sorghum cultivars: the pre-flowering, drought tolerant sorghum cultivar RTx430, and the post-flowering, drought tolerant (or ‘stay green’) cultivar BTx642
      
            Four compartments: Leaf, Root, Rhizosphere, Soil
